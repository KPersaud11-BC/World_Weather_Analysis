# World_Weather_Analysis by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the World Weather Analysis
Plan My Trip is a travel technology company specializing in the hotel and lodging industry. This analysis collects and presents hotel and weather data that will be further filtered based on customer travel preferences. The assignment has three deliverables.

1. The code has to retrieve weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API call of various cities throughout the world, and then consolidate that into a single DataFrame.
2. The code has to use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, and identify a list of destinations and nearby hotels using that criteria. The code then has to map those locations with a marker on an interactive map using Google Directions API. Each marker will contain pertinent information for the customer, including the name of the hotel and the current weather description.
3. The code has to use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary of 4 cities, and plot it on an interactive map. In this analysis, I prepared an itinerary map of 4 cities in China.
